# Profanity Checker

## Inspiration

Whether it is a technical documentation, blog or an article businesses need to take care of the fact that no obscene content gets promoted through their brand or else it can harm their brand image. Therefore, a profanity check needs to be implemented on the brand content before publishing it online.

Implementing the profanity check methods manually for large-scale necessities can be a daunting, time consuming and costly affair to practice. Hence, an automated content moderating solution is very much required to save costs, efforts and time of the businesses in managing their brand content.

## What it does

Profanity Checker is a Content Moderator that analyzes Confluence pages for Profanity and alerts the user if it finds any profane words. This is automatically using Natural Language Processing.

## How We built it

We built it using Atlassian Forge, Forge UI and Confluence APIs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to build apps very fast using Forge was very easy. It was a great learning for the both of us. We would definitely love to build more apps for Atlassian Products using Forge.

## What we learned

We learnt how Atlassian Forge could be used to build apps for Atlassian Cloud products. Building the app using Forge was a great experience as it does most of the work for you. All we need is to code!

## What's next for Profanity Checker

- Extend the capability to Jira Service Desk issues
- When Forge adds more capabilities, we would like to extend the capability of this app to identify profane words in the response being written by a Support Representative.
